                <p>Hi there! I’m a professional with a solid background in engineering and commerce, having earned my BEng (Hons) | BCom from the <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland </a>. I spent four years as a Project Manager in residential construction working in the family business <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://www.kemkarcapital.co.nz/developments">Kemkar Capital/Kemkar Construction </a>. I managed multiple builds with over 50 contractors to deliver high quality homes on time and under budget. This role sharpened my project management skills and taught me how to solve complex problems efficiently.
                </p>

                <p>Recently, I decided to dive into the tech world, driven by a passion for continuous learning and new challenges. I’m currently on a path to learn programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, as well as frameworks such as Node.js and React.js. My analytical mindset and project management experience make me well-suited for software engineering roles, where I can apply my skills to develop effective solutions.
                </p>

                <p>I’m excited about the opportunities in the tech industry and eager to connect with like-minded professionals. With my diverse background and commitment to continuous improvement, I’m ready to transition into software engineering and build a successful career. Let’s build something amazing together! </p>
                    
                <p>p.s. I have also just recently moved to Melbourne from Auckland, New Zealand!

                    <p>Worked in two sister companies started by my Father: one focused on multi-unit residential construction and the other on raising capital for these <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://www.kemkarcapital.co.nz/">projects</a>. I was significantly involved in all aspects of the business, but these are the highlights of what I did over 4 years: <br><br>
                        - Communicated with and organized contractors efficiently on site.<br>
                        - Managed project planning, risk evaluation, and material organization to minimize delays and costs.<br>
                        - Established the legal framework for Kemkar Capital, ensuring compliance with FMA regulations.<br>
                        - Held <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://youtu.be/7-KnWXVJS38?si=GZ9L03yxbU7cIjr8">presentations</a> to an audience of potential investors to get them to invest in our financial product.
                        - Prepared quarterly reports, communicated with investors, and created marketing materials.<br>
                        - Gained experience in legal language, financial statements, cashflow projections, sales, marketing, project management, and construction processes.</p>

                        </a>
                        <p>During the period of quarantine in New Zealand, I transformed my parents’ brick-and-mortar store, <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://organicsoutwest.co.nz/">Organics Out West</a>, into a fully operational e-commerce platform. Initially collaborating with a software developer, I populated the Wordpress website with around 4,000 products and integrated it with our POS system. Unsatisfied with the initial results, I independently migrated the site to Shopify, focusing on UI/UX design. This comprehensive e-commerce setup significantly boosted the business’ performance during COVID-19 and positioned it for a successful sale in 2022.<br><br>
                            - Integrated the website with the POS system to synchronize data, ensuring seamless operations between online and in-store sales.
                            -Updated the original Wordpress site with copywriting and new products.<br>
                            - Migrated the website to a new Shopify store, independently setting up and managing the platform with a strong focus on UI/UX design to enhance revenue and other key metrics.<br>
                            - Added custom .liquid code to Shopify templates to improve functionality and user experience.<br>
                            - Actively managed the online store, maintaining high standards of performance and aesthetics.<br>
                            - Contributed to the successful sale of the business in 2022, with the current website closely resembling the version I developed.</p>
